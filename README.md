# Ticket Printer Bot

A user-installable Discord bot that send ticket messages to a printer.

Not much more to it, it uses `satori` to format the tickets and `node-thermal-printer` to send them to the printer.

Maybe at some point it will be smarter than that, but I just wanted to provide some people to ping in me in a more fashionable way.
